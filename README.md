# 2-D_MMSE_equalizer
design and implement a 2-D equalizer in order to use in wireless systems, especially OFDM systems that has insufficient cyclic prefix.
so, in a system with presence of the ISI in which we should use channel shortenning to decrease the length of the channel response and as a consequence the complexity of viterbi algorithm
